# ImageSliderApp
This is an image slider app.This app will create interactive, rotating displays of multiple images, often in a carousel or slideshow format. Includes navigation dots as well as a slide counter. A pause on hover feature has now been added as well as fade transitions. Keyboard navigation is now available. Slides can now be switched with the left and right arrow keys. Optimizing a function and error handling still to come too. I'm trying to create the best image slider app possible.
