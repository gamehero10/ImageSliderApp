# ImageSliderApp
This is an image slider app.This app will create interactive, rotating displays of multiple images, often in a carousel or slideshow format. Includes navigation dots as well as a slide counter. Navigation dots are small circles below the slider that show current slide and allow jumping to specific slides. A pause on hover feature has now been added as well as fade transitions. Fade transitions use opacity and transitions instead of showing or hiding slides abruptly. Keyboard navigation is now available. Slides can now be switched with the left and right arrow keys. Finally includes swipe support as well as responsive images. Optimizing a function and error handling still to come too. I'm trying to create the best image slider app possible.
